# ART302
Contents of my Python scripting work in Autodesk Maya for automating rigging for the ART302 module.

These files contain code that I created while following Gnomon Workshop's 'Master Rigging and Python Scripting.' 

None of this code is useable and it does not work in engine as the course that I got from Gnomon Workshop was missing some core material needed for the code they directed the viewer to use.
My plan for this code was to write it while following the tutorials and then once I saw how it worked I would change and adapt it to work for my full quadraped rig. 
As I never managed to see how it worked due to the missing materials meaning the code wouldn't run, I was unable to adapt the scripting for my own use. 

I felt it was important to still show the work I did on this as I spent many weeks working through this workshop. 
At first, I thought that it was a mistake I was making that was the reason behind the code not working. It was only after I attempted multiple lessons with the same results that I came to the conclusion that it was not my own mistakes, but missing resources from the files provided by the workshop.
